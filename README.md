# Ladybug Classification Project

School project conducted in collaboration with Steven Bradley, focusing on the automatic classification and spot counting of ladybugs, with a focus on Harmonia axyridis species.

## Overview
This collaborative project aims to automate the study of ladybug populations. The goal is to develop a machine learning approach that can automatically detect the ladybug species and count the number of spots on an image.

## Objectives
1. **Species Identification:** Implement a machine learning model to automatically identify ladybug species, with a focus on distinguishing Harmonia axyridis from other species.
2. **Spot Counting:** Develop algorithms to count the number of spots on ladybug images, providing valuable data for population analysis.
3. **Automation:** Create an automated pipeline for processing ladybug images, from data input to species identification and spot counting.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) - Used for interactive and collaborative development.
- [Machine Learning Libraries] - Utilized for training and deploying the ladybug classification model.
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) - Version control and collaborative development.
